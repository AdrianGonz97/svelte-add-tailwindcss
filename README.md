<h1 align="center">💨 Add Tailwind CSS to Svelte</h1>

## ❓ What is this?
This is a **work in progress** command to run to add Tailwind CSS to your Svelte project.

## 🛠 Usage
You must start with a fresh copy of the official `create-svelte` template, which is currently created by running this command:
```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up Tailwind CSS:
```sh
npx use-preset babichjacob/svelte-add-tailwindcss  
```

This will write the code for you that sets up Tailwind CSS (and PostCSS for now -- subject to change).
